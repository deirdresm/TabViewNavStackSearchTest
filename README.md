# TabViewNavStackSearchTest

Was trying to sort out how exactly to make `.searchable` work in the context of NavigationStack inside TabView. Note that all tabs share the search text, they just interpret it differently because of differing data models.

* SwiftUI
* SwiftData
* TabGroup
* NavigationStack
* Searchable
* Sorting
* â€¦and Toolbar to work together.

This is a little example, hope it helps you.
